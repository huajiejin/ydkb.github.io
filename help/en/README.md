# Welcome to use YDKB 
Currently some documentations for English are missing. You can use online translation service.

> - It is recommended to use Chrome or Edge browser for best compatibility.
> - The latest versions of Firefox and Safari are currently supported as well.

This document is for the use of https://ydkb.io. You can also visit the following address:

(Global) https://ydkb.github.io,  [View this on GitHub](https://github.com/ydkb/ydkb.github.io)<br>

The firmware used by YDKB is based on TMK, so most of the instructions can be found in addition to this help document, as well as the relevant instructions for TMK. 

TMK Wiki: https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard/wiki

But on the basis of TMK made a certain simplification and modification. The purpose is to make it easier for you to use the firmware, do not need any programming foundation.

On the left is the directory. If it is a mobile browser, expand the sidebar at the top and start browsing.

> [!ydda] ATTENTION
> - The website of ydkb.io is only used to generate firmware with your keymap.
> - It can not read or write any information from or to the keyboard.

Here, too, are some basic rules from the beginning of my own vision:
  1. Try not to download software to complete the firmware update. (This needs the MSD Bootloader)
  2. Only under the condition of human intervention can keyboard information be read or written. This includes updating firmware, reading keymap, etc.
  3. No need to run any driver software for daily use.

> [!yddh] Useless knowledge
> - About YDKB's name, YD is mainly from a comic named "Ultimate Otaku Teacher".
