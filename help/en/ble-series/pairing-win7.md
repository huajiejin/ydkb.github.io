<html><div class="attention">
<subtitle>ATTENTION</subtitle>
<ul><li>win7 is released earlier than Bluetooth 4.0, and Microsoft has not updated win7 to support Bluetooth 4.0</li>
<li>So to use Bluetooth 4.0 keyboard, you must use a third-party driver. </li>
<li>It is recommended to update to Win10; if you must use it under Win7, continue reading.</li><ul>

## Intel's Bluetooth hardware

If you check that your wireless network card is Intel, then Intel's official website may also provide Win7 Bluetooth drivers. According to the user's reply, Intel's official driver can use BLE devices after installing it under Win7.


## CSR8510 chip Bluetooth receiver

The bluetooth 4.0 adapter most people use should be the chip CSR8510. This chip can work with bluesoleil's driver.

<ul><li>Bluesoleil is a paid software. You can also directly buy an authorized Bluetooth adapter</li>

### 1 Install bluesoleil

Plug in the Bluetooth adapter during installation or after installation is complete.

Note: My win7 computer was very old and slow. After restart, the keyboard was unavailable in the login interface, but other users said that the login interface was available.

After entering the system and the bluesoleil driver boots, the keyboard will be automatically connected, and it can be used directly without any problems.


## Other Solution
Alternatively, Win7 can also use Niz's dongle (see [Niz dongle](ble-series/pairing-niz-dongle.md) ).
