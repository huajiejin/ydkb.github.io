# Layer Tap Toggle

In ydkb.io, this function is displayed as LT. 

It combines [Layer Momentary](edit-keymap/l-layer.md) and [Layer Toggle](edit-keymap/t-layer.md) into one key.



For example, if a key is set to LT1, then:
1. When the button is held down, it is to momentarily open layer 1
2. Tap it continuously several times, it is toggle layer 1 on or off.
 
he firmware starting from 2023.01.16 is unified to tap three times. Most prior to this date were double-tap.
